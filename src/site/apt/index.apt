Maven 2 Macker Plugin - Introduction

 Macker is a build-time architectural rule checking utility for Java developers. It's meant to model the architectural ideals programmers always dream up for their projects, and then break -- it helps keep code clean and consistent. You can tailor a rules file to suit a specific project's structure, or write some general "good practice" rules for your code. Macker doesn't try to shove anybody else's rules down your throat; it's flexible, and writing a rules file is part of the development process for each unique project.
 
 Macker is free software, available under the terms of the GNU Public License. Macker was originally developed by Paul Cantrell.
 
 Macker uses BCEL to analyze Java bytecode.
